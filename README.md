Movie Recommendation System using Python

A movie recommendation system is a type of machine learning system that recommends movies to users based on their previous viewing habits, ratings, and preferences. One common approach to building a movie recommendation system is to use feature vectors.

A feature vector is a mathematical representation of a movie's attributes, such as its genre, actors, director, and plot. Each feature is assigned a numerical value that represents its importance or relevance to a particular user. For example, a user who prefers action movies may assign a higher value to the "action" feature and a lower value to the "romance" feature.

To build a movie recommendation system using feature vectors, the system first collects data on a user's movie preferences. This data may include information on the movies the user has watched, rated, or searched for. Based on this data, the system creates a feature vector that represents the user's movie preferences.

Next, the system compares the user's feature vector to the feature vectors of all the movies in the system's database. The system calculates a similarity score between the user's feature vector and each movie's feature vector. The similarity score measures how closely the user's preferences match the attributes of each movie.

Finally, the system recommends movies to the user based on the highest similarity scores. The system may also use other factors such as the popularity of the movie, the user's previous ratings of similar movies, and the release date of the movie.

In summary, a movie recommendation system that uses feature vectors works by creating a mathematical representation of a user's movie preferences and comparing it to the attributes of all the movies in its database. The system then recommends the movies with the highest similarity scores to the user.
